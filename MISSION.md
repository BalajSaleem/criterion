# Criterion - Mission & Vision

> **"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best...."**  
> — Quran 16:125

## Our Purpose

Criterion exists to bring the authentic teachings of Islam to anyone seeking knowledge, using modern technology to make divine guidance accessible to all of humanity.

We are not just a chatbot. We are a **Da'i** (invitor to Islam) — a bridge between seekers and the truth, a companion for those exploring faith, and a guide grounded in the fundamental sources of Islamic knowledge: the Quran and authentic Hadith.

---

## Our Mission

**To provide authentic Islamic knowledge with wisdom, compassion, and clarity — freely accessible to all of humanity, powered by state-of-the-art technology, for the sake of Allah alone.**

---

## Our Pillars

### 1. Truth, Reliability, Authenticity & Accuracy

**Trust is sacred.** When someone seeks knowledge about Islam, they deserve the truth — not fabrications, not hallucinations, not misinformation.

**Our commitment:**

- Every response is grounded in authentic sources: the Quran and verified Hadith collections
- We cite real sources with hyperlinks to established references (Quran.com, Sunnah.com)
- We prioritize Sahih (authentic) Hadith and clearly indicate the grade of reliability
- We never fabricate verses, hadiths, or religious rulings
- When we don't know, we say so — clarity over confidence, truth over convenience
- We build systems that prevent hallucination through tool-based retrieval and verification

**Why it matters:**  
People trust us with their faith journey. We honor that trust by never compromising on authenticity. Our technical choices — from embeddings to citations — all serve this commitment to truth.

---

### 2. Fundamentals & Simplicity

**Islam is simple at its core.** The message is clear, the guidance is accessible, and the fundamentals are unifying.

**Our commitment:**

- We focus on core Islamic teachings from the Quran and Sunnah
- We avoid sectarian debates, divisive issues, and controversial interpretations
- We present what is universally accepted, well-grounded, and clear
- We serve seekers, new Muslims, and the curious with compassion and patience
- We prioritize wisdom and empathy over complexity and controversy
- We keep our answers concise, focused, and rooted in the fundamentals

**Why it matters:**  
The message of Islam is for all of humanity. By staying focused on the fundamentals, we make Islam accessible to those who seek it most — the curious, the questioning, the searching. We are not here to debate; we are here to guide.

### 3. For the Sake of Allah (Fi Sabilillah)

**This is not about us.** This is not about promoting an individual, an organization, or a brand. This is about serving God by serving humanity.

**Our commitment:**

- Criterion will always be free and accessible to everyone
- We seek no worldly gain, no recognition, no ownership of this knowledge
- We build for the sake of God, and we seek our reward only from Him
- This mission belongs to all Muslims and benefits all of humanity
- We are stewards of this platform, not owners.

**Why it matters:**  
Purity of intention is the foundation of all good deeds. By keeping Criterion free, open, and focused on service, we ensure that this work remains an act of worship — a Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity) that benefits seekers long after we are gone.

> _"When a person dies, all their deeds end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for them."_ — Sahih Muslim 1631

---

### 4. State of the Art

**Knowledge is light, and technology can be its vessel.** We use the best tools available to bring Islamic guidance closer to those who seek it.

**Our commitment:**

- We leverage cutting-edge AI to make Islamic knowledge searchable, accessible, and conversational
- We build fast, reliable, and accurate systems that serve users with respect
- We innovate constantly — exploring new ways to deliver guidance to the masses
- We stay at the forefront of technology to unlock new possibilities for Da'wah
- We combine ancient wisdom with modern tools to reach global audiences

**Why it matters:**  
The Quran was revealed in stages to make it accessible to the people of that time. Today, we have new tools — natural language AI, semantic search, multilingual interfaces — and we use them to make the Quran and Sunnah accessible to the people of _our_ time. This is how we honor the message: by delivering it effectively.

## The Bigger Vision

Criterion is more than a RAG chatbot. It is:

- **A Da'wah platform** — guiding seekers to Islam with wisdom and compassion
- **A knowledge bridge** — connecting people to authentic Islamic sources in their own language
- **A trust-builder** — demonstrating the clarity and beauty of Islam through accurate, grounded responses
- **An accessibility tool** — making the Quran and Hadith searchable by anyone, anywhere
- **A Sadaqah Jariyah** — ongoing charity that benefits humanity and earns continuous reward

We envision a future where:

- Anyone, anywhere can ask a question about Islam and receive authentic, compassionate guidance
- The Quran and Hadith are as accessible as a conversation
- Seekers find clarity, new Muslims find support, and the curious find truth
- Language is no barrier to understanding Islam
- Technology serves faith, not the other way around

---

## Our Guiding Principles

1. **Authenticity over speed** — We will never sacrifice accuracy for performance
2. **Clarity over complexity** — Simple, focused answers rooted in fundamentals
3. **Compassion over brittleness** — We guide, with truth, without creating difficulties
4. **Service over self** — This is for Allah and humanity, not for us
5. **Innovation over tradition** — We use the best tools to serve timeless truth
6. **Accessibility over exclusivity** — Free, open, and available to all

---

## Who We Serve

- **New Muslims** — Reverts looking for guidance and support
- **Students of knowledge** — Anyone learning about Islamic teachings
- **All of humanity** — Because the message of Islam is universal

---

## What We Are Not

- We are not a fatwa service — we provide foundational knowledge, not legal rulings
- We are not a debate platform — we guide with wisdom, not argumentation
- We are not sectarian — we focus on what unites, not what divides
- We are not commercial — we will never monetize access to Islamic knowledge
- We are not infallible — we are human builders, accountable to Allah for our work

---

## Our Commitment to the Community

This is a collective effort. We welcome:

- **Contributors** who share our mission and values
- **Feedback** from scholars, developers, and users
- **Collaboration** with those building similar tools
- **Accountability** from the Muslim community we serve

We build in the open, we listen humbly, and we improve constantly.

## The Name: Criterion

The name comes from the Quran itself:

> **"Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion (Al-Furqan) upon His Servant that he may be a warner to the worlds."**  
> — Quran 25:1

**Al-Furqan** — the Criterion — is a name for the Quran, meaning "that which distinguishes truth from falsehood."

Our platform aims to embody this: helping people distinguish truth from falsehood, guidance from misguidance, clarity from confusion. We do this by connecting them directly to the Criterion itself — the Quran — and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

---

**May Allah accept this work, forgive our shortcomings, and make it a source of guidance for those who seek the truth.**

**Ameen.**
